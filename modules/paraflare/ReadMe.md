# Paraflare Module
## Authors: Tinfoilhate, StatusRed, and Soultechnology

This script allows users to ACE self-interact and have an option to launch flares into the sky.
While you can use handflares to throw and M203 flares, these are inventory parachute flares which take up little room, light weight, and are cool.
Updated with new launched flare. Now makes an audible 'pop' when it ignites, goes inert if it hits something on launch, and works (without color) in broad daylight. 
You can now also fire flares from FFV seats, on foot, and more (specifically anywhere you can throw a grenade / use your primary weapon)

Add the following flares to your classes/roles in your loadout file and that's it, no further editing of settings is needed. (All share the same weight/size)
